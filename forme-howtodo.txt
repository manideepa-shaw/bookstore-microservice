Dependency
----------
1. testcontainers (Service connection & local development support) - you can use
   Testcontainers to spin up a real MySQL Docker container for
   integration testing — no need to install MySQL locally for tests

2. actuator - gives you ready-to-use endpoints for monitoring and managing your app — like health checks,
   metrics, environment info, etc.
